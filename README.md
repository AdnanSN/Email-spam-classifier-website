Greetings people!!!

Here's how you can run my email spam classifer in your own machine and get accurate classifications.

Step 1: Clone my repository in your machine or download the zip file of my repository by clicking on the "Code" button.

Step 2: Run the "Train_model.py" file. What this program does is it trains the model and then produces a "spam_classifier.pkl" file.

Step 3: Now run the "app.py". What this does is it utilises the "spam_classifier.pkl" file to essentially perform the classification.

Step 4: After succesfully running the "app.py" file, your website should be running on your local host, to view the website go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000" in your browser to use the application.

Thank you!!!
